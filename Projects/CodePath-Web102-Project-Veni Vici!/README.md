# Web Development Project 4 - *Veni Vici!*

Submitted by: **Jessie Estrada**

This web app: **displays one element at a time with information through API calls in a random fashion. It is similar to the now-defunct SumbleUpon. In this case, it is a web app all about cats! This web app also includes a ban list that will influence the next random cat they will see.**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

This app was very challenging for me. I had trouble pulling the information from the API. Since this was my first time working with a publicly available API, I had difficulty reading the documentation and knowing how to setup all the information based on what I understood from the API documentation.
